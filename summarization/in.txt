A tumbler is a drinking glass with straight sides. The coast is an area of land that is next to the sea sides. I need to sort my hashmap according to the values stored in it.  The hashmap contains the contacts name stored in phone. also I need that the keys get automatically sorted as soon as I sort the values. or you can say the keys and values are bounded together thus any changes in values should get reflected in keys.There are sorted maps such as TreeMap, but they traditionally sort by key rather than value. It's relatively unusual to sort by value . especially as multiple keys can have the same value.
